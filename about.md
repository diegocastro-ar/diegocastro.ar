I’ve been messing around with hardware and software for most of my life.
I am currently SysAdmin, but my beginnings were as a HelpDesk for several years, I have experience in networking, virtualization, hardware troubleshooting and automation of almost everything. I love Python, Bash scripting, and try to get hands-on experience of all the cool new and emerging technologies. I have been a Linux sysadmin for the last 10 years and a power user of Windows. I am self-taught and have a huge drive to keep learning.

I am currently running Proxmox in my home lab where I do my experiments. Most of the inspiration for my articles comes from being able to have a lab of my own and I’m all for privacy respecting self-hosted apps.

I hope to keep this place fresh and informative…
